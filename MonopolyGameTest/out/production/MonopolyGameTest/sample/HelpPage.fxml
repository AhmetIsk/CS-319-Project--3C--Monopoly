Each&#10; player is given a sum of money (The amount of the money changes depending on the &#10;game edition). Game coins are placed in the bank box. A player works as a bank clerk. &#10;This player manages the bank issues in the transactions of other players. For some &#10;editions, during the game, each player can  make their own transactions with the bank &#10;(If the game plays among 2 people this way can be preferred.) &#10;&#10;Before the Game:&#10;&#10;Each player chooses a pawn and places it at the starting point. Each player receives a &#10;certain amount of money from the bank official before the game starts. This game is&#10; the starting fee. It is evenly distributed to each player. To choose which player will &#10;start first, dice  are rolled. The first player to  start the game is determined by dice. The &#10;player who gets the maximum number starts first.The player which starts first will have&#10; the right to buy the first property. If the player who rolls the first dice buys a &#10;property, the other 7 players can fall here and pay rent. Therefore, starting fist is an &#10;advantage.  &#10;&#10;&#10;Start the Game:&#10;&#10;The game starts by rolling the dice.  If a player rolls the dice double, they have&#10; the right to roll the dice one more time. If the player rolls the dice 3 times in the &#10;same turn, he goes to jail. If the player comes to a property, the player&#10;can become the owner of that property by paying the purchase price of that property &#10;to the bank. The banker gives this person  the title deed of that property. He receives&#10; rent from the player falling on that property. If the player does not want to buy the&#10; property, the game passes to the next  player..&#10;If the player falls into a jail as a result of his roll of dice, the player stays in jail for &#10;3 rounds. To get out of jail, he or she has to get the exit jail card beforehand or pay &#10;some money.&#10;If the player roll reaches the &quot;Draw Card&quot; section, the player draws a card." />
