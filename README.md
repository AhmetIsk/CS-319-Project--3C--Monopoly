1. About the Game

Monopoly is a well-known board game that mainly focuses on trading between the players through real estate, properties. Main aim of this game is to be the richest one and by trying to make other players go bankrupt, winning the game. Therefore, the main topics of the game are strategy and economy management. In this project, the game will be modified with new innovations and re-designed for computers.

2. How to Play

	The game is played by at least two people. The pawns that are selected at the beginning of the game represents the players. Each rolls the virtual dice whenever it is their turn. Based on the number on the dice, the pawns move on and come to a represented land. The player either chooses to buy the land if it is unowned and has sufficient money to get it or pays the rent if it is owned by another player or just passes the turn intentionally. The game continues until there is one player left not bankrupt or decide on the richest among other players left in the game.

3. Innovations for Users

1.	 We will provide players with the trade option so that a new strategy will be added to the game. Players will be able to trade their cities for each other if they want. If there are hotels or houses in the exchanged cities, these structures will be included in the swap.
2.	The game can be played among players. Additionally, users who wish will be offered the option to "play against the computer".
3.	Each user will be able to choose the background color of the interface.
4.	Moves made since the beginning of the game will appear on the screen as a history part to be able to determine new strategies.
5.	Animations will be added to entertain the players.
6.	Our project will offer users “country options” before the game starts. Thus the cities of the game will load accordingly.
7.	This will be a monopoly space edition. Planets will replace lands and spaceships will be instead of vehicles. Home, hotel and forest can be planted on the planets.
8.	An alien object will be added to the game as a new mode. A part called alien invasion will be added to the board. When the player comes to the alien invasion part on the board, one of the created alien objects with different properties will be selected randomly and punish the player according to his own characteristics. These penalties are:
1.  Don't fall into a black hole. (There will be a black hole instead of free parking.)
2. Seize some of the player's money.
3. Seize a random deed.
